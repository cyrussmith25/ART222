<h2>Project 1: Vector Graphics</h2>

<p> The assignment for this project was to make a logo for the Southworth Planetarium located at USM Portland. While I have experience working in Photoshop for digital photography, I have never used Adobe illustrator so this was certainly a learning curve. When I was working on the lab assignment for this project, the entire program kept crashing and was immensely frustrating which I found impacted my concept for the project. Originally I had wanted a logo with a lot more texture details but at least I was able to get the majority of what I wanted, althoguh it came out a lot more simplistic than I intended. I did create two versions of this logo so I have included all of them here, my favorite is the one with radial lines but it would not realistically work for a logo. I also included the radial image with a blue background which is how I would hypothetically see it working best.</p>

<h3>Project 2: Photo Manipulation</h3>

<p> Having taken the digital photography class last semester, I felt very comfortable with Photoshop. While most of my experience with Photoshop is editing my own photographs in more subtle ways, I found this project very fun. I got a bit stuck on the theme of this project but I am happy with how they came out regardless. </p>

<h4>Project 3: Video Editing</h4>

<p> This project was all about video editing with public domain clips. I really enjoyed this project, in high school I used to do a lot of video editing and I did some for my digital photography class so it wasn't super unfamilar. I wish I had pushed the bounds of this project more but I think I will continue to work on things like this, possibly using the same clips from this project.</p>

<h5>Project: 3D Modeling</h5>

<p> I have never done any 3D modeling whatsoever so i really expected to struggle with this but I enjoyed it. I think it helped that I picked one of my favorite possession that also happens to be very geometric in natural but I think this would be a fun to explore in the future. It was also an interesting experience knowing that my best friend from high school who just graduated with a game design degree uses this program all the time. </p>
