<h2>Project 1: Vector Graphics</h2>
<p> The assignment for this project was to make a logo for the Southworth Planetarium located at USM Portland. While I have experience working in Photoshop for digital photography, I have never used Adobe illustrator so this was certainly a learning curve. When I was working on the lab assignment for this project, the entire program kept crashing and was immensely frustrating which I found impacted my concept for the project. Originally I had wanted a logo with a lot more texture details but at least I was able to get the majority of what I wanted, althoguh it came out a lot more simplistic than I intended. I did create two versions of this logo so I have included all of them here, my favorite is the one with radial lines but it would not realistically work for a logo. I also included the radial image with a blue background which is how I would hypothetically see it working best.</p>
